# randomserie

This is a simple python code for those who are indecisive about which serie they are going to watch now. 
This code asks you about the genre you want to watch and then pick a choice based on that. 
I left another version commented that uses the random feature to help you pick one of the series you list. In this case it does not consider the genre
